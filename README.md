# Python Coding Guidelines

This repository is a guideline of some coding I've been learning. 
I like to think that I still can learn as much as possible, so this is a readme explaining (with examples) some python that improved my coding, and I hope can also help others.

The explanations given in all the following sections assume that **you know the basics of Python**.
If you are a Python newby, this repo will help you to get better, although it is not a tutorial.
If you are more advanced programming, I hope the explanations given make you even better coder.

It is no holy text, so don't take everything as a must, but as a recommendation for coding with Python following most of the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
If there is any modification that you might think it would improve this guide, anyone can open a pull request and ask me for the review.
This guide is organized in different folders, each one explaining the ideas of the topic.

Here are also some online tools, which can help depending on the python script that you are working on:
